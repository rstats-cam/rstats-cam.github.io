title: "cambRidge R User Group"
---

We're an R community based in Cambridge, connecting members of the University, the broader scientific community, startups and enterprises at the Science Park and anyone in Cambridge or with links to Cambridge.

We're brand new, so join our group to learn more of our events lineup as we roll this out!

This is an official RUG supported by the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).

Find us on [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/cambridge-r-user-group/).
