Welcome to the CambRidge User group!

We are a new R User Group (RUG), aiming to bring together and build a community of R users in Cambridge.

This is an official RUG supported by the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).

## Why do we need an R user group in Cambridge?
_Isn't there already one in London?_ 

_Well, yes but..._ 

...it is our view that a RUG really is an opportunity for the local R community to come together, share ideas and foster connections. While it is great to attend talks (and there will be some great ones!) this is really a vehicle to form a local community, and bring people together who might otherwise never interact with each other.

Cambridge is really well-situated to host a RUG. First and foremost, we already have a well established [R Ladies Cambridge](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-cambridge/) group, and secondly Cambridge is a real hub of research and innovation. 

Of course, there are the well-known universities, but there are also other research institutes such as the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/) or the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/), as well as major companies such as Apple and Microsoft. Of course R is also widely used in the public sector, in various local councils ([SODA](https://www.suffolkobservatory.info/soda/)) and the NHS ([NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/)).

These are all very different organisations, but we have one thing in common: _R_.

The East of England in fact, is a bit of an RUG desert! We think this RUG could have a wider impact beyond Cambridge, there might be interest in Norfolk (UEA, Earlham Institute) and Suffolk (BT, EDF) and would encourage anybody to come along - even if you are not based in Cambridge!

## So what are we going to do?
We are currently planning four sessions running in 24/25, with the following _provisional_ themes:

First Thursday of the Month:

* September - *R in Teaching*
* November - *R in the Life Sciences* 
* January - *R in Production*
* March - *R in Climate & Sustainability*

These are quite broad topics, but this is intentional. We want to be a community-led group, and we love to platform local speakers that would like to speak on one of these topics. Please get in touch if you are interested in speaking!

## Session Format
Sessions will be hosted at Newnham College, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DF.

Our meetings will take place on Thursday evenings, with of course some drinks and nibbles provided (thank you [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/r-user-group-support-program)!).

We will start with a talk from an invited speaker, followed by lightning talks by local RUG members. 

All meetings will then be followed by informal mingling in a venue _TBC_ nearby.

## Who is this RUG for?
Anyone with an interest in R! Whether you are a seasoned R expert, or a complete beginner, you will be more than welcome in the Cambridge R user group.
